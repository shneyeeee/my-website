The initial name of java was “Oak”. <br> It was changed to Java by Sun’s marketing department changed it to “java” when they found that name was already registered for some computer company.<br>
Java was made by an accident. Around 1992, James Gosling was working at the Sun Labs.<br> He and his team at that time were building a set-top box and which is started by “cleaning up”<br> the C++ and they all wound up with a new language called Java or Oak.

    What Is Java?
Java is a widely-used and high-level progrmaming language first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995 and it was known as Oak before it was renamed as Java.<br> and was later obtained by Oracle Corporation.<br> It is designed to be platform-independent meaning that any codes made in Java can run in any devices that supports<br> the Java Virtual Machine(JVM) making it a pretty convinient programming language,<br> and that specific capablity of Java is often referred to as "write once, run anywhere"(WORA).<br>
Java is object-oriented which means that it focuses mainly on objects and data rther than on actions and logic.<br> This makes it a highly modular, scalable and easy to manage programming language in terms of building large and complex applications.<br> Java also supports multiple concepts such as inheritance, incapsulation, and polymorphism,<br>which are foundations to  object-oriented programming.<br>

Key Features of Java
    
1. Platform Independencs
    Java codes runs in Java Virtual Machine(JVM), making it possible to perform the same codes on different kinds of operating systems.<br>
    Ex: Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.
2. Robust and Secure
    Java has resilient memory management features and automatic garbage collection, reducing the cases of memory leaks.<br> It also has a variety of security features such as bytecode verification and sandboxing to prevent untrusted code from infiltrating the sofware and cause harm to the systems.
3. Multithreading
    Java also allows the continuous execution of different parts of a program,<br> making it convinient for applications that needs a high performance, like web servers or gaming. 
4. Rich API and Libraries
    Java provides a wide set of Application Programming interface(API) and libraries for networking, data structures, databases,<br> GUI development, and more, which makes it flexible and adaptable to different kinds of development, including web, desktop,<br> and mobile applications.

Conclusion
Java has evolved significantly since its inception in the early 1990s, growing from a language designed for consumer devices to a major platform for web applications,<br> mobile apps, and enterprise software.<br> Its emphasis on portability, security, and performance has kept it relevant for decades.

<summary style=color:black">How Did Java Started?</summary>
<pre>
Java. It's one of the most popular and used programming languages in the tech world. But how did it all stared.?<br>
Java is a programming language developed and made by its author and creator James Gosling in the early 90's.<br> It was originally designed for digital cable. After James Gosling's failed attempt on trying to expand on C++, he decided to make a project named "Greentalk<br> - with its file extension being in 1991 along with Mike Sheridan, Patrick Naughton and many more at Sun Microsystems<br> and they were called "The Green Team". Greentalk was later on renamed becoming "Oak" on the first version of Java.<br>
Although in the Beta on 1995 they have to change the name from "OAK" to Java due to it being trademarked by Oak Technologies.<br> Java's First Version being v1.0 was released on 23rd of January, 1966.
