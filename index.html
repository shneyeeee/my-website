        <h2>People in Media</h2>
        <p>
            "People in media" generally refers to individuals who are involved in the production, creation, and distribution of media content. This can include a wide variety of roles across different forms of media, such as television, film, radio, print, digital media, and social media platforms.
            Key roles might include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Journalists – Reporters, editors, and news anchors who gather, write, and present news.</li>
            <li>Content Creators – Individuals who produce videos, blogs, or other online content (e.g., YouTubers, influencers, podcasters).</li>
            <li>Producers – People who oversee the creation and development of television shows, films, and digital content.</li>
            <li>Actors and Performers – Individuals who appear in films, television shows, or advertisements.</li>
            <li>Directors and Writers – Those who create scripts, direct projects, or provide creative vision for media content.</li>
            <li>Social Media Managers and Influencers – People who manage social media accounts or create content to influence audiences.</li>
            <li>Technicians – Those who handle technical aspects like camera operation, sound design, editing, and post-production.</li>
            <li>Executives and Managers – People in charge of media companies, stations, networks, and production houses.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The phrase "people in media" highlights the professionals involved in shaping how information, entertainment, and news are delivered to the public.
        </p>
        
        <h3>People as Media</h3>
        <p>
            Here are some key aspects of "people as media":
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Social Media Influencers: Individuals on platforms like Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok who create content that can reach and influence large audiences. These people shape trends, opinions, and consumer behavior through their personal branding.</li>
            <li>Citizen Journalism: Ordinary people can report news, share firsthand accounts, and distribute information, often bypassing traditional media outlets. This has become especially prominent during events like protests or crises where individuals can share real-time updates.</li>
            <li>User-Generated Content: Platforms like YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter allow anyone to create and share content, turning users into content creators. These platforms rely on individuals to generate much of their content, which in turn shapes the platform's value and audience engagement.</li>
            <li>Personal Branding: Individuals build and curate their own digital presence, becoming influential "media" themselves. People can turn their personal stories, skills, or expertise into media brands that attract followers, sponsors, or partnerships.</li>
            <li>Peer-to-Peer Communication: Instead of relying solely on institutions or organizations to deliver media, people can share content and ideas with their networks directly, which often has a greater impact due to the trust in personal connections.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In summary, "people as media" reflects the shift from traditional media gatekeepers (like journalists, broadcasters, or publishers) to individuals who control their own media presence and content distribution, leveraging digital tools to communicate with others.

        <h2>What is Java?</h2>
        <p>
            Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language designed for portability, performance, and security. It was developed by Sun Microsystems in 1995 and is now owned by Oracle Corporation. Java is widely used for building applications that run on a variety of platforms, thanks to its principle of "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA). This means that Java code can run on any device or operating system that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed, making it cross-platform compatible.
        </p>

        <h3>Key Features of Java</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Object-Oriented:</strong> Java uses classes and objects, promoting reusable and modular code.</li>
            <li><strong>Platform Independence:</strong> Java programs are compiled into bytecode, which the JVM interprets and executes, making Java applications platform-independent.</li>
            <li><strong>Multithreading:</strong> Java supports multithreading, allowing multiple tasks to be processed simultaneously.</li>
            <li><strong>Robust and Secure:</strong> Java emphasizes strong memory management, exception handling, and built-in security features to prevent common programming errors and vulnerabilities.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Java is used for a wide range of applications, from web development (using frameworks like Spring) to mobile apps (Android development) and enterprise-level software systems.
